# STOR_601_RT2

## Discrete Simulation Optimisation Algorithms

The repository includes:
- [NSGS.R](./NSGS.R): implementation of NSGS algorithm written based on pseudo code by Nelson et. al. (2001)
- [KN.R](./KN.R): implmentation of KN algorithm written based on pseudo code by Kim and Nelson (2006)
- [s_S_inventory.R](./s_S_inventory.R): $(s,S)$ inventory problem adjusted from coursework example in STOR 606 Stochastic Simulation module
- [testing_algorithms.R](./testing_algorithms.R): script with testing the algorithms on $(s,S)$ example with different sets of feasible solutions including plots
- table of optimal values of $4950$ solutions to the inventory problem (simulated as mean of $10000$ replications)
- boxplots of number of simulations of each solution across $50$ macroreplications
